              The period in between june to september signifies downpour,it
              brings with it the fragnance of desire. Smoothening winds,lively
              nights discloses flattening mood. It unveils the human
              sensuality.. The long nights fetches with them the boozing breezes
              that are intolerably toxic, the toxicity that unravels inhuman
              urge. And the unexplored ocean beside brings out the very joy in
              exploring the urge.
              <br />
              <br />
              One among those days, A women waits for a bus at a stop, her
              hair's completely wet ,as if it was soaked in a tub of water and
              the dress too got dampened slightly. A tiny droplet trying to
              explore her paving a path from her hair to bottom,got wiped out
              with the woman's very own elegant hands. Her eyes elegant as she
              is. They are in search of something, something that raptures her
              urge that she's been clinging onto for so long. Her very eyes
              symbolises craving ,the very craving for men.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sravani, a 27 year old woman , she works at an exports and imports
              company and is a personal Assistant working at the helper desk
              from morning till evening. Her day starts standing at the bus stop
              for NRT-102 Bus, that drops her at the office.Married and elegant
              ,yet a deficit shadows her life. It is the absence of love..
              <br />
              The bus stop is crowded with men, woman ,children of all ages..Yet
              Sravani searches for the one who provides her, an ample amount of
              what she truly desires for..
              <br />
              A message pops up in the mobile from an unknown number,saying
              "Baby!have you reached the bus stop?". Sravani looks at it with no
              intention of attempting a reply to it. Meanwhile second message
              pops out, "had your husband left you at the stop?". Sravani
              replies to the second one,texting "yes he had and Im at the bus
              stop baby!" . Instant rply flows in from the other end "ok then
              ,take care baby Love you!.".A cheery glow brightens up in
              Sravani's face. She replies immediately acknowledging the love
              from the other person. Then message flows over continuously,,
              Meanwhile the bus she's been waiting for arrives at the stop.And
              she lifts her head in search for a seat from the stop. She at once
              become dumbfounded by seeing a guy , he had stylish looks and his
              anatomy is adorable. he is well build and decent. He has a ear
              ring symbolizing fashion, yet looks decent.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sravani at once leapes through the crowd to get into the bus. She
              makes way through the crowd inside the bus to reach the man she
              has been anticipating for.Yet last, she senses that her long
              lasting thirst will get fullfilled. She reaches out to the
              man,Sanjay. And she irresistably murmurs if she could occupy the
              seat next to him. Sanjay is deeply involved in listening to music
              with his headset and he didn't show any reaction nor give any rply
              to the girl. Sravani out of her insane urge to interact with him
              and her excitement of meeting the man she desired for ,,she
              couldn't resist herself and calls him tapping on his shoulder..
              Without a word uttered from her, sanjay replies immediately,
              "Yes!,Please". The journey begins...
              <br />

              introduce herself..
              <br />
              "nice name,Iam Sanjay",Sanjay replies.
              <br />
              "Do you take the same bus daily?" Sravani asks desparately.
              <br />"Yeah,I take this bus only,I get off the bus at my office"
              Sanjay notifies.
              <br />

              office" Sravani delightfully.
              <br />"Where do you actually?" Sanjay asks her eagerly.
              <br />
              "I work at Manmadh Export and Imports" Sravani replies and shows
              her id.

              "And how haven't we meet till now? Oh god" Sravani murmurs
              disappointed. <br />

              eagerly. "I work as P.A and i'll be there at the help desk,most
              familiar" Sravani satires. <br />
              "haha, I work at the shipment department ,2 floors below yours"
              Sanjay with a smile. "Anyways it's so nice to meet you" Sravani
              feeling relieved. <br />
              "Same here" Sanjay acknowledging.
              <br />
              Meanwhile a text pops up in Sravani mobile saying, "Have you
              reached the office baby?" . Sravani ignores it and switches off
              her mobile trying not to let anything disturb their conversation.
              <br />
              "And our boss ,he's Yama" Sanjay exclaims.
              <br />
              "he always pokes us,doing things,assigning works everyday ,aah! I
              can't" Sanjay innocently . <br />Saravani listens to his innocence
              , the aroma of his words makes her cling to him.She gets deeply
              rooted with the conversation watching him constantly. <br />
              "One day i'll replace him as the CEO and then you'll be my P.A.
              Will you be?" Sanjay asks her f.
              <br />
              Sravani dwells in the trauma that binds her to him and won't
              respond . "Sravani are you alright?" Sanjay doubtfully.<br />
              "Yeah I will be" Sravani gladly..
              <br />
              <br />
              The bus reaches the company.<br />
              They both gets off the bus talking<br />
              Sravani ,"Will you take the same bus to return?"."Yeah, why?"
              Sanjay<br />
              "nothing ,just." Sravani tries to convey what she's feeling
              indirectly. <br />
              "haa , so you need to take the stairs here" ,Sanjay directs her<br />
              "hmm yeah, and Could you give me your mobile num.." Sravani tries
              to ask his mobile number.<br />
              In the meantime,
              <br />A person shouts at Sanjay saying ,"Sanjay you need to come
              quick".<br />
              "Ok I need to go , anyways nice meeting you" Sanjay leaves .<br />
              Sravani stands still , and she only remembers the tip of the hand
              that touched him. She then takes stairs and makes bills and
              documents but she could only think of his presence. His face
              reverbrates all over her and his words slides through out her.
              <br />
              "Hello ,hello madam ", A person shouts from behind tapping over
              her shoulder..
              <br />
              Sravani turns back and she could see his face and only his face
              over everbody.<br />
              "hello Sravani ! hello" Sanjay call her Shouting.
              <br />
              Sravani could only hear someone mumbling and she realizes it's him
              <br />
              "Ohh ,hey hi" Sravani replies Surprised.
              <br />
              "Sir , ask me to set these papers , Where should I?." Sanjay
              incompletedly <br />
              "Yeah, put them in the drawer in sir's office" Sravani relies .<br />
              "Thank you " He acknowledges .
              <br />
              she could watch him through the door,and she loves his innocence
              of keeping the records organised, She just remembers his every
              action and his feats in achieving it.
              <br />
              Meanwhile ,
              <br />
              A message pop ups ,"Is everything fine there baby?" from the
              unknown.<br />
              Sravani warmly,"Haa baby!, missing you badly."<br />
              "Don't worry, We'll catch up sometime", From the unknown.<br />
              She involves herself in completing her works and the clock ticks 4
              .
              <br />
              She immediately packs everything and descends the steps to 1st
              floor
              <br />
              "Is Sanjay here?",Sravani Asks desparately<br />
              "Sanjay ? No he just left now" Watch head informs her.<br />
              Sravani ,then descends the steps and peeps out through the window
              . She finds Sanjay taking the bus
              <br />
              She descends the stairs
              <br />
              "hey stop ,," She shouts after the bus.
              <br />
              inspite of her shouting , the bus leaves ,,
              <br />
              Sravani stands there,,still hoping that they would take the same
              bus ,sitting beside, and chatting , exploring the unexplored . She
              now got deeply rooted with his presence ,and had an ultimate
              craving to be with him ..
              <br />
              A message pops up ,"Had your husband picked you up, baby?" unknown
              <br />
              "No baby!" Sravani replies distressed.
